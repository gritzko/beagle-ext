//  JSQUE-006: the JOIN primitive over a job-queue ULOG (boundary marker +
//  back-scan fold).  A barrier is a fold-verb row that, when reached,
//  BACK-SCANS via lib/ulog.js::seekBack (JSQUE-003) to its boundary marker
//  and folds the intervening leaf rows into ONE result.  Post-order emission
//  (marker, leaves, then the fold row) gives the ordering; plain FIFO +
//  seekBack do the rest.  Results are DURABLE — the fold re-reads the rows,
//  holds nothing in memory — so a replay over the same range is idempotent
//  (same range -> same aggregate).  Nested barriers chain via rows: a fold's
//  result row is a leaf of an outer fold (blobs -> subtree -> root tree).
//  Mirrors the C wtlog pd/patch boundary semantics (sniff/AT.c; wtlog.js
//  boundaries() + eachPutDelete's strictly-after-the-floor fold).
